# alx-low_level_programming

## Project Overview
This project focuses on mastering pointers, arrays, and strings in C through practical implementations. It includes tasks that simulate real-world low-level programming challenges, such as memory manipulation and string operations.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Pointer arithmetic
- Memory management
- String manipulation
- Array traversal
- Algorithm optimization

## Compilation
All files were compiled with:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
```

## Why This Project Matters
- Demonstrates foundational C programming skills.
- Shows ability to work with memory addresses directly.
- Highlights problem-solving in constrained environments.
